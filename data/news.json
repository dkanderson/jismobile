The DBJ, he said, will, among other things, market the website, raising the awareness of SMEs and borrowers to its existence.<\/p>\n<p>Director, Professional Services Unit at the MSBM, Dr. William Lawrence, said\u00a0 the project offers \u201cvery important benefits\u201d for MSMEs, including saving on time and cost in sourcing financing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt will save businesses time by providing a one-stop-shop when looking for sources of financing; it will save money and cost by allowing businesses to compare the features of the different funding options available and making the best choice that suits their own situation; and it will contain up-to-date information on what is available and where it is available,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Williams informed that the project will include a feedback mechanism for users to provide useful information to improve the site.<\/p>\n<p>The DBJ is wholly owned by the Government of Jamaica and is mandated to foster economic growth and development of strategic sectors of the Jamaican economy.<\/p>\n<p>It was created in April 2000, from the merger of the Agricultural Credit Bank of Jamaica Limited and the National Development Bank of Jamaica Limited.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Operators of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) will soon have access to an online database that will provide information on sources of financing for their businesses.

East Clarendon became the first to receive tablet computers under the Tablets in Schools (TIS) Pilot Project during a distribution exercise at the school on Thursday, September 11.<\/p>\n<p>The project is a collaboration between the Ministry of Science, Technology, Energy and Mining (MSTEM) and the Ministry of Education and is being implemented by e-Learning Jamaica Company Ltd (e-LJam) and the Universal Service Fund (USF). Parents and guardians accompanied their children to the school where they signed an agreement outlining the care and proper use of the devices.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking at the handover, the Hon. Phillip Paulwell, MSTEM Minister, urged parents to ensure that students take care of the devices and use them for educational purposes. He told the parents to get the word out that it made no sense for the tablets to be stolen because they could be tracked by the police and they were designed to be shut down if they were misappropriated.<\/p>\n<p>Continuing, he said that not only would the tablets help to improve students&#8217; education, but they would also prepare them for the job market and solve some of the problems in their communities. \u201cSoon our children will be using these devices to make money from the programmes they will design\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The Hon. Ronald Thwaites, Minister of Education, also speaking on the occasion, noted that Salt Savannah Primary had a challenge in meeting its literacy targets, but that the TIS pilot project was expected to help in addressing this. He noted that a school in rural Jamaica was chosen as the first recipient of the tablets, to send a message that children do not have to live in urban areas to access quality education. He also called on the parents to send their children to school every day, even if they had no lunch money.<\/p>\n<p>Rudyard Spencer, Member of\u00a0 Parliament for the area in which the school is located, thanked the government for including the school in the project. He disclosed that Councillor for the area, Winston Maragh had ensured that a secure storeroom was built at the school to temporarily house the tablets if it became necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Students and teachers in 38 educational institutions will receive some 25,000 tablets under the year-long pilot project. Teachers in the pilot institutions have already received their devices and have undergone training in the integration of technology in education in order to effectively deliver lessons in the classroom.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Students of Salt Savannah Primary and Infant School in South East Clarendon became the first to receive tablet computers under the Tablets in Schools (TIS) Pilot Project during a distribution exercise at the school on Thursday, September 11.

Dr. Fenton Ferguson, says the global and national burden and threat of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) constitute a major public health challenge, which undermines social and economic development.<\/p>\n<p>He pointed out that World Health Organization (WHO) statistics show that an estimated 63 per cent of deaths across the world are due to NCDs, particularly cardiovascular diseases (48 per cent), cancers (21 per cent), chronic respiratory diseases (12 per cent), and diabetes (3.5 per cent).<\/p>\n<p>In his message, read by Acting Permanent Secretary, Dr. Kevin Harvey, at the launch of Caribbean Wellness Day, held at PAHO\u2019s University of the West Indies, Mona campus offices, on September 10, Dr. Ferguson said that recent national surveys also showed an increase in the major behavioral risk factors and NCDs, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, among adults.<\/p>\n<p>The Ministry of Health will join the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO), to observe Caribbean Wellness Day 2014, on Saturday, September 13, as part of efforts to increase awareness of non-communicable diseases and how they affect the population and the economy.<\/p>\n<p>Noting that the World Economic Forum estimates that the burden to countries due to deaths associated with NCDs was $22.8 trillion in 2010, he said this is expected to increase to $43.3 trillion in 2030, if inroads are not made in stemming NCDs.<\/p>\n<p>In 2001, the estimated cost of diabetes and hypertension in Jamaica was US$461 million.<\/p>\n<p>The Minister emphasised that it is in recognition of this burden and the threat of NCDs that the Ministry has developed a road map \u2013 the National Strategic and Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2018.<\/p>\n<p>The Action Plan is expected to result in a significant reduction in the burden of preventable morbidity and disability and premature mortality due to NCDs and injuries by 25 per cent by 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Making the link with the theme for the Day, \u2018Preserving the Workforce for National and Regional Development\u2019, the Minister said\u00a0 that, \u201cwe must recognize the enormous burden that we face and that our workforce and our economy are in jeopardy if we do not collectively and decisively combat the scourge of NCDs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He cited last year\u2019s implementation of the Public Health (Tobacco Control) Regulations, as a major move made to address NCDs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe continue to urge businesses and others to put the necessary measures in place, so that their workers can live a better and healthier life and breathe easier,\u201d the Minister urged.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, PAHO\/WHO Country Representative, Noreen Jack, said workplaces should make healthy food choices available, and support and encourage physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorkplace wellness has the potential to reach significant proportions of the adults who are employed\u2026it works through influencing behaviours at multiple levels, directly, such as through education, increasing the availability of healthy foods, and the opportunities for physical activity &#8211; or indirectly, through social \u00a0support and social norms and promoting healthy behaviours,\u201d she outlined.<\/p>\n<p>The CARICOM Port of Spain Declaration calls on Member States to observe Caribbean Wellness Day on the second Saturday of September each year.<\/p>\n<p>The annual event, which was initiated in 2008, provides an advocacy opportunity to increase awareness of the burden of NCDs in the region; mobilize and strengthen public, private, and civil society partnerships for NCDs; showcase national community level activities to promote healthy living, and encourage citizens to develop good health practices.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Minister of Health, Hon.

Licensing Regime for Sawmill and Power Saw Operators","title_plain":"New Licensing Regime for Sawmill and Power Saw Operators","content":"<p>Effective January 2015, all sawmill and power saw operators must be registered and licensed with the Forestry Department to operate legally in Jamaica.<\/p>\n<p>The new policy, which falls under the Forest Regulations of 2001, is aimed at regulating the island\u2019s sawmilling industry as well as providing greater protection for the country\u2019s forests.<\/p>\n<p>Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water, Land, Environment and Climate Change, Alwin Hayles, made the announcement on Wednesday morning, September 10, while addressing the official launch of the Sawmill Licensing Programme and Registry at the Hotel Four Seasons in New Kingston.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Hayles said the programme is a well-needed intervention in the Government\u2019s efforts to preserve and conserve the island\u2019s forests.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Forestry Department remains committed to the protection of the forests on crown lands and the encouragement of the conservation of forests located on private lands,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n<p>Under the licensing system, persons who intend to operate sawmills must receive a licence from the Forestry Department. The application fee is $15,000, and once granted, the licence is valid for one calendar year, after which it must be renewed.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Hayles informed that a license is required whether the source of the lumber is from private or public lands.<\/p>\n<p>He further noted that any sawmill operator found to be in breach of the requirement will be liable for prosecution and could be fined a maximum of $50,000, or in default of payment, could be sentenced to up to one year in prison at hard labour.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the Permanent Secretary informed that the information collected from the licensees will be used to populate the Sawmill Registry, which will be housed at the Forestry Department. \u201cIf you are not listed in that register, you face the possibility of being prosecuted for operating a sawmill without a licence,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>For his part, Principal Director for Forest Operations, Forestry Department, Keith Porter, said the agency is expecting full compliance with the new regulations.<\/p>\n<p>As such, the Forestry Department will embark on a public education campaign, which will involve several public meetings across the island to sensitize individuals about the programme. He noted that the campaign will commence immediately and continue into early next year.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Porter informed that property owners including homeowners, who use power or other types of saws for personal purposes, such as for pruning trees on their properties, will not be required to get a licence, unless they intend to use their saws to engage in commercial activity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Forestry Department hopes that through the introduction of these measures, we will be better able to regulate the logging practices within our state and privately owned forests,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, Mr. Hayles informed that in short order, the Ministry will take\u00a0 the New Forest Policy for Jamaica to Cabinet.<\/p>\n<p>The policy will give community stakeholders greater access to utilise forested areas in a sustainable manner and will provide greater support for the regulation of the industry by the Forestry Department.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe policy also sets out a vision, principles and goals relating to our forestry sector, and looks at the national priorities for forests including our efforts at conservation, protection and reforestation,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>It also addresses the role of the country\u2019s forests in supporting rural livelihoods and the sustainable use of the island\u2019s forest resources.<\/p>\n<p>The Forestry Department has employed a number of measures as part of its efforts to protect forests and encourage sustainable use of its resources.<\/p>\n<p>These initiatives include the declaration of 3,700 hectares of crown lands as forest reserves and forest management areas; increased patrols to detect illegal activities including joint patrols with the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF); increased sensitisation sessions with the public on the forest laws; and the continued implementation of the agency\u2019s permit and licensing system, which regulates access to the island\u2019s forest resources.<\/p>\n<p>It is estimated that the island\u2019s annual deforestation rate is 0.1 per cent or the removal of approximately 300 hectares of forests every year. This includes the removal from crown lands as well as privately owned holdings.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Effective January 2015, all sawmill and power saw operators must be registered and licensed with the Forestry Department to operate legally in Jamaica.

the Government\u2019s Electronic Labour Exchange (ELE) facilities as the country seeks to improve its labour market outcomes and reduce the level of unemployment.<\/p>\n<p>Chief Technical Director in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, Errol Miller, said employers can take advantage of the inexpensive approach to recruitment as they fulfill their need for workers, while jobseekers can post their resumes to the Labour Market Information System (LMIS).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough the ELE, employers can post job openings and search for matching candidates on the LMIS website, while jobseekers can upload their resumes and apply for jobs online,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Miller was addressing the opening of a job fair hosted by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) through its ELE and LMIS units on Wednesday, September 10, at the Knutsford Court Hotel, New Kingston.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to matching employers and jobseekers, the ELE also provides job search techniques, career counseling, resume writing, and access to information on scholarships and loans.<\/p>\n<p>The ELE forms part of the LMIS, which has two other components \u2013 Labour Market Intelligence and a Skills Bank, which houses a database of skills and occupation within the labour market.<\/p>\n<p>Currently the Labour Market Intelligence provides data relating to levels of employment, education levels of persons in the labour force, and the types of education and training, which would be required by the labour force.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Miller said the MLSS, through its Planning, Research and Monitoring unit, will update its information by conducting two research projects to unearth the types of skills and jobs in demand as well as the reasons for the low participation of women in the labour force.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Miller also pointed to the $8 million recently refurbished ELE facilities at the Ministry\u2019s North Street Office, which he said, is part of the MLSS\u2019 vision to reproduce similar centres in each parish across the island.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis enhanced facility will allow us to strive towards our goal of customer service excellence while at the same time, providing greater offerings to our clients. Our overarching objective is to establish one-stop centres across the island providing job linkages between jobseekers and employers,\u201d said Mr. Miller<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Miller wished the gathering of employers and jobseekers well in their quest to meet their labour expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe hope the tips that will be shared today will help you to gain confidence and assurance for your job search, connect you to resources so that you can be more knowledgeable about the labour market and enable you to become active managers of your career paths,\u201d he expressed.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, representative of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Janet- Jean Quarrie, reaffirmed the Bank\u2019s commitment to the Government and the people of Jamaica in the evolution of its national employment portal.<\/p>\n<p>The IDB approved a US$30 million loan towards the ELE in keeping with its mandate to improve human capital and the labour market outcomes of the poor.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Quarry cited recent ratings on the international level have shown major improvement in Jamaica\u2019s macro economic situation and said the future outlook for the country is positive and hopeful.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Quarry said that the loan is to be used to \u201cdevelop a private sector strategy and the use of job solicitors to increase job listings in growth sectors, to promote partnerships with the private sector through the development of satellite facilities in private sector entities and in parishes, and finance a series of baseline studies to support development and consultations on a national employment policy and strategy\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The services of the LMIS are free of cost to the public.

Brazil\u2019s government, along with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), are partnering with Jamaica to implement the initiative, for which a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) formalizing the arrangement, is to be signed by the major stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>At the launch on Tuesday, September 9, at the Planning Institute of Jamaica\u2019s (PIOJ) New Kingston offices, Education Minister, Hon. Rev. Ronald Thwaites, said its implementation will ensure that children, particularly at the early childhood level, have access to adequate nutritious meals each day, thereby fortifying their development.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that in that first 1,000 days (of a child\u2019s life), and beyond, to perhaps grade eight, is the time of brain formation, or personality development, when nutrition plays a tremendously important role,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He stated that the \u201cknowledge\u2026 of the Brazil model of school feeding will be of inestimable opportunity for us in Jamaica. This is exactly the kind of cooperation we need for Jamaica, and I trust that the information that will be purveyed, will not only be a fillip to the local economy, but, also, be a tremendous strength to the process of education.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In his remarks, Acting Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, Hon. Derrick Kellier, said the initiative is integral to \u201cour holistic drive for the National Food Security and Nutrition Programme.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we wish to have a nation that is healthy, then we must ensure that our young children are properly fed and, from the earliest stages, be involved in pursuing a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, our educational, health, and agricultural policies and programmes must be crafted and implemented in such a way as to enhance convergence and collaboration to ensure the best outcomes,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is for this reason that the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is fully committed to ensuring the supply of more nutritious and locally grown foods throughout the nation, specifically in the school feeding programme,\u201d Mr. Kellier assured.<\/p>\n<p>Health Minister, Hon. Dr. Fenton Ferguson, gave the Ministry\u2019s commitment to \u00a0playing its part to achieve the goals that have been outlined in the (project) MoU.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In his remarks, FAO\u2019s representatives to Jamaica, Belize, and the Bahamas,\u00a0Dr. Jerome Thomas said that school feeding programmes are important in promoting food and nutrition security in countries where they exist.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey also impact on the implementation of public policies for the achievement of the right to food.\u00a0 For these reasons, school feeding programmes are, therefore, recommended as one of the major strategies for addressing long-term sustainable development,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>PIOJ Director General, Colin Bullock, said the project represents an important partnership between regional governments and the Government of Brazil, supported by the FAO, while Charge d\u2019Affaires at the Brazilian Embassy in Jamaica, Alfonso Nery, said his Government welcomes the opportunity to share the key components of its school feeding programme with Jamaica.<\/p>\n<p>Key among the project\u2019s initial engagements is a two-day workshop, being conducted by visiting Brazilian school feeding experts, for 45 participants from several government ministries, departments, and agencies, at the PIOJ, which commenced on September 8.<\/p>\n<p>The workshop\u2019s participants also include representatives from Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Lucia, where similar programmes are slated for implementation.<\/p>\n<p>Following the workshop, the participants will receive additional training, which will run until December 16.<\/p>\n<p>Brazil boasts one of the world\u2019s most successful school feeding programmes in the world. Managed by the National Fund for Educational Development (FNDE), Brazil\u2019s programme currently provides nutritious food to more than 45 million children across the South American nation, through integrated public policy development and implementation with other government sectors.<\/p>\n<p>Brazil\u2019s involvement in Jamaica\u2019s project forms part of the Government\u2019s commitment to South-South cooperation, particularly with Caribbean countries.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Over 300,000 students are expected to benefit from an integrated school feeding project, to be implemented by the Government.

to roll out a more targeted and sustained programme to tackle illegal vending, and restore order to the streets of the Corporate Area.<\/p>\n<p>Mayor of Kingston, Senator Angela Brown Burke, told the monthly meeting of the Council on Tuesday, September 9, that the problem appears to have worsened over the past several weeks, with an eight-year old boy suffering an eye injury after he came into contact with metal hangers on display on a sidewalk along one of the city\u2019s streets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have received several complaints of the level of intimidation meted out to pedestrians and motorists by vendors, who have their wares blocking access to our roadways and pathway,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The Mayor, in expressing regret at the incident, said that she and the Town Clerk have met with the family, and are working with the police in its investigations to find the person responsible for the act of negligence, which resulted in the injury to the child.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis points out very squarely the reasons why we have been advocating for vendors to remain in designated vending areas. This has only strengthened our resolve to ensure that illegal vending is brought under control,\u201d she stated.<\/p>\n<p>Mayor Brown Burke warned that the Council will be taking a zero tolerance approach to illegal vending, and is committed to ensuring that law and order prevails, \u201cin our markets, in our parks, and along our streets\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, she informed that the KSAC has removed and demolished 16 illegal constructed wooden and concrete structures, in several communities, which were being used for commercial and residential purposes.<\/p>\n<p>The operations were carried out over several weekends in the communities of Maverly, Duhaney Park, Washington Boulevard, and its environs.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, notices were served on illegal garages, and eight derelict vehicles removed from sidewalks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis clean-up operation will help to make the Maverly Park more accessible to its residents for recreational purposes,\u201d she remarked.<\/p>\n<p>On the matter of the fire at Oxford Mall, which impacted the lives and livelihood of 40 vendors, she informed that the area has been cleared, and plans are in place to have normalcy restored as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs soon as we are in a position to say exactly how we will proceed, the KSAC will meet with registered vendors,\u201d she stated.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC) has met with the police to roll out a more targeted and sustained programme to tackle illegal vending, and restore order to the streets of the Corporate Area.
