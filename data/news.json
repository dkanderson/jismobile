seek to consolidate and expand the bonds of friendship which exist between our two countries through cultural exchanges and cooperation.

Additional Courtrooms Open at Justice Square","title_plain":"Three Additional Courtrooms Open at Justice Square","content":"<p>Three additional courtrooms have been provided at the Supreme Court on King Street in downtown Kingston, increasing the number to 15.<\/p>\n<p>They are located on the adjacent building at the intersection of King and Barry Streets, which formerly housed a branch of the National Commercial Bank (NCB).<\/p>\n<p>The building was acquired and is being refurbished by the Ministry of Justice, under its multi-million dollar Justice Square Project, incorporating further development of the area in the Supreme Court\u2019s immediate precincts.<\/p>\n<p>The new courtrooms are currently being used for the 2014 Michaelmas Term of the Home Circuit Court. Work to develop the remaining four courtrooms is currently underway.<\/p>\n<p>In her address at the start of the Michaelmas Term, on Tuesday, September 16, Chief Justice, Hon. Zaila McCalla, said the new facilities will go a far way in resolving space constraints at the Supreme Court.<\/p>\n<p>She pointed out that the Supreme Court\u2019s administration no longer has to resort to alternatives, such as using the caucus rooms at the Jamaica Conference Centre, on Duke Street, for trial sittings.<\/p>\n<p>The Chief Justice expressed the hope that the remaining courtrooms and supporting facilities will be completed in short order.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the number of cases listed for trial during the Michaelmas Term, which lasts from September to December, has decreased by 14.06 per cent, compared to the similar period last year.<\/p>\n<p>A breakdown of the list provided by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for this year shows 507 cases down for trial, as against 590 at the start of the 2013 session.<\/p>\n<p>Senior Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathy Pyke, who gave a breakdown, said the majority of the cases for the Michaelmas Term comprise the 483 brought forward from the Easter session, with 24 new committals to bring the total to 507.<\/p>\n<p>Mrs. McCalla said despite the relatively high number of cases listed, \u201cvaliant efforts\u201d have been and will be made to reduce the number of cases.<\/p>\n<p>She appealed for the commitment and cooperation of judges, attorneys, and the police to ensure that cases, particularly criminal matters which dominate the list, are thoroughly investigated and prepared, and appropriately presided over to ensure that justice of the highest standard is dispensed.<\/p>\n<p>The Chief Justice implored persons summoned to serve as jurors to respond accordingly to ensure that the judicial process is not stalled.<\/p>\n<p>She also urged employers to facilitate their staff with the time to serve, once they have expressed a willingness to do so. The Chief Justice also thanked those persons who have served as jurors.<\/p>\n<p>Also attending the ceremony were Custos of Kingston, Hon. Steadman Fuller; Custos of St. Andrew, Hon Marigold Harding; and the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) Area Four Chaplain, Rev. Dr. Mortimer Mullings.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"galleria photocrati-nextgen_pro_horizontal_filmstrip \" data-id=\"85987\" id=\"displayed_gallery_85987\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<script type=\"text\/x-galleria-style-template\" id=\"css_overrides_85987\">\n\t\t.galleria-stage .galleria-image img {\n\t\n\t\tborder-color: #ffffff;\n\t}\n.galleria-thumbnails-container {\n\theight: 90px;\n}\n.galleria-thumbnails .galleria-image {\n\twidth: 120px;\n\theight: 90px;\n}\n.galleria-stage {\n\tbottom: 96px;\n}\t<\/script>\n\t<div class=\"galleria-batch\" style=\"display: none\" id=\"displayed_gallery_batch_85987\">\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ngg-image-0\" class=\"batch-image\" >\n         <img\n             data-title=\"Three additional courtrooms open at Justice Square\"\n             data-alt=\"Three additional courtrooms open at Justice Square\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/three-additional-courtrooms-open-at-justice-square\/p1.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/three-additional-courtrooms-open-at-justice-square\/thumbs\/thumbs_p1.jpg\"\n             width=\"1280\"\n             height=\"1251\"\n             data-image-id=\"2537\"\n             data-description=\"Chief Justice, Hon.

Ministry of Education have partnered on a three-year project, aimed at improving the leadership of 15 primary and secondary schools in three parishes.<\/p>\n<p>The iLead project, which was launched on Tuesday, September 16, at the Terra Nova Hotel in St. Andrew, will be implemented in institutions in Portland, St. Mary, and\u00a0St. James, which have been identified as in need of assistance.<\/p>\n<p>It seeks to strengthen instructional and organisational leadership in the schools, by building the capacity of principals, heads of departments, and education officers. The expected outcome is marked improvement in academic performance, and leadership of the schools.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking at the launch, Minister of Education, Hon. Rev. Ronald Thwaites said initiatives such as iLead have the potential to drive the transformation, which is needed in the education sector.<\/p>\n<p>He said that while \u201cthe old norms and traditions\u201d in education have \u201cput us in a good place,\u201d there is need for improvement in order for the country to realise the national objectives set out in Vision 2030.<br \/>\nDirector of Education Programmes at the JN Foundation and head of iLead,<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Renee Rattray, said it is anticipated that the public-private partnership \u201cwill turn around the lives of our children\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a cry for stronger and better leadership in almost every area of our nation\u2026our schools, which are the cradles of educational development, also suffer from this leadership deficit,\u201d she noted.<br \/>\nShe pointed out that the programme recognizes the need for a \u201cone Jamaica\u201d approach to education, and so it will involve critical stakeholders including communities, parents, teachers, ancillary staff, administrators, the government and the opposition.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough the iLead programme, we will bring all of these stakeholders together over the next three years to transform the academic and social outcomes of children in the 15 schools,\u201d she stressed.<\/p>\n<p>Chairman of the iLead advisory board, and leader of the Opposition, Andrew Holness, pointed out that while the programme will affect all aspects of education in the targeted schools, the focus will be on institutional leadership in education.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we want is that after the programme comes to an end, that the changes are institutionalized, and that other institutions can benefit from them. We want to leave behind leaders, who are now catalysts and agents of change in the education system,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Holness lauded JN for having taken the risk of implementing new and innovative methods in the education system. \u201cBut it is a risk that will be very positive for Jamaica, because many of the innovative techniques and strategies that which will be employed are tried and tested and proven around the world,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>iLead is a follow-up to the Centres of Excellence programme implemented in 2008 by the JNBS in collaboration with the Victoria Mutual Building Society (VMBS), and which targeted six rural non-traditional high schools. The programme was completed in 2013 after five years in the schools.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Jamaica National (JN) Foundation and the Ministry of Education have partnered on a three-year project, aimed at improving the leadership of 15 primary and secondary schools in three parishes.

It is being spearheaded by the Jamaica Business Development Corporation (JBDC).<\/p>\n<p>The initiative will be carried out via mobile office units that will offer a full suite of business development services, in addition to services offered by Government agencies, including Jamaica Promotions Corporation (JAMPRO), the Consumer Affairs Commission, Bureau of Standards\u00a0 Jamaica, Companies Office of Jamaica, among others.<\/p>\n<p>Main objectives of the project are: to facilitate business formalisation, market access and market entry; to increase awareness of business development services; to provide training, capacity development and technical support; to promote sound entrepreneurial practices through public education; and to sensitize MSMEs about the Government\u2019s reform agenda, including the Secured Interest in Personal Property (SIPP) Act and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Bill.<\/p>\n<p>Addressing the launching ceremony, held on September 16, at the National Commercial Bank\u2019s (NCB) Wellness Centre, Phoenix Avenue, in Kingston, Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce, Hon. Anthony Hylton, said the Government is committed to developing a comprehensive training and development framework for MSMEs in various areas, so that they can improve their operational efficiencies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe importance of micro, small, and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) is unquestionable. MSMEs are the foundation of today\u2019s economy. These entities are responsible for many of the new jobs created each year in our country, and have the potential to create many new jobs. They must be nurtured, and they must be supported at all levels,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Lauding the initiative, the Minister said it is a calculated, deliberate effort to strengthen support to the MSME sector, in order to foster growth and improve competitiveness.<\/p>\n<p>He noted that it seeks to integrate the various support organizations in Jamaica and bring them directly to MSMEs across the length and breadth of the island.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are facilitating ordinary Jamaicans in growing their businesses, in creating employment for themselves and others, and most importantly, in growing our economy,\u201d the Minister said.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Corporate Communications Manager, JBDC, Keneshia Nooks, said the clinics will be implemented in major town centres and remote communities across Jamaica.<\/p>\n<p>She informed that the services to be offered include: financial consultation, technology innovations, business advice, consultation and formalisation, logistics hub training, standards and certification and business modelling.<\/p>\n<p>Importantly, Ms. Nooks added, partners will facilitate value chain linkages through clustering and connections with other business partners, as well as provide expertise in project management, research and business monitoring support.<\/p>\n<p>She said Mobile Clinics will begin on October 29, 2014 and will be held monthly over a three-day period until the close of the pilot phase on September 24, 2015.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe programme will then be evaluated before the implementation of year two, in late 2015,\u201d she noted.<\/p>\n<p>Two private sector partners &#8211; National Commercial Bank (NCB) and Fidelity Motors Limited &#8211; have pledged their support to the programme.<\/p>\n<p>During the ceremony, NCB donated $13.5 million to the initiative, while Fidelity Motors will be providing the vehicles.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"galleria photocrati-nextgen_pro_horizontal_filmstrip \" data-id=\"85997\" id=\"displayed_gallery_85997\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<script type=\"text\/x-galleria-style-template\" id=\"css_overrides_85997\">\n\t\t.galleria-stage .galleria-image img {\n\t\n\t\tborder-color: #ffffff;\n\t}\n.galleria-thumbnails-container {\n\theight: 90px;\n}\n.galleria-thumbnails .galleria-image {\n\twidth: 120px;\n\theight: 90px;\n}\n.galleria-stage {\n\tbottom: 96px;\n}\t<\/script>\n\t<div class=\"galleria-batch\" style=\"display: none\" id=\"displayed_gallery_batch_85997\">\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"ngg-image-0\" class=\"batch-image\" >\n         <img\n             data-title=\"MSMEs to Benefit from Mobile Business Clinics\"\n             data-alt=\"MSMEs to Benefit from Mobile Business Clinics\"\n             data-src=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/msmes-to-benefit-from-mobile-business-clinics\/DDP-1.jpg\"\n             data-thumbnail=\"http:\/\/jis.gov.jm\/wp-content\/gallery\/msmes-to-benefit-from-mobile-business-clinics\/thumbs\/thumbs_DDP-1.jpg\"\n             width=\"1280\"\n             height=\"806\"\n             data-image-id=\"2542\"\n             data-description=\"Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce, Hon.

I think things have developed, but we haven\u2019t managed to develop,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Mukulu said as such, his office has been working with the Ministry of National Security to effect changes to the Act.<\/p>\n<p>He noted that among the areas of concern is the fact that under the law, an inmate who applies for parole is not required to be present at the hearing where his or her fate is being decided. It is up to the discretion of the Parole Board to determine whether or not the inmate is present.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is something anomalous and wrong in saying to me that \u2018you are about to determine whether or not I have been rehabilitated and whether I can go back into society\u2019, and I am not, as a matter of right, allowed to even be in the room where my fate is being determined,\u201d Mr. Mukulu argued.<\/p>\n<p>The acting Public Defender said the procedure cannot be deemed fair if the inmate or a representative is not present at his own parole hearing.<\/p>\n<p>He pointed out that discussions with some 13 inmates from the St. Catherine Adult Correctional Facility and the Tower Street Correctional Facility, over the last two months, have revealed that none of the inmates, who have applied for parole, were ever informed that the Board had the discretion to invite them to the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Mukulu is, therefore, calling for a review of this aspect of the law, noting that in most jurisdictions across the Commonwealth, an applicant is given the right to appear before the Parole Board.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven if one is not allowed to be present, the second option is that the inmate should have a representative there,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Mr. Mukulu argued that the inmates or their representatives are not allowed to view the reports, which are often submitted to the Board by the Probation Officers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe applicant is not given that all important opportunity to consider and respond to that report. That again has been found in other jurisdictions to be against the basic right to a fair hearing,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t challenge what you have said against me \u2018how fair is that process?,\u201d he questioned.<\/p>\n<p>However, Mr. Mukulu concedes that his office recognises that there must be instances in which reports are withheld from inmates.<\/p>\n<p>The acting Public Defender explained that an amendment of the law is necessary to protect the rights of citizens and to safeguard against \u201ca litany of constitutional motions being brought before the Courts\u201d by applicants who feel they have been wronged.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Mukulu further noted that his office has an obligation to contribute to law-making to ensure that laws which are passed achieve balance between protecting human rights and those of the public.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Acting Public Defender, Matondo Mukulu, is calling for a review of the country\u2019s Parole Act, noting that much has changed since the law was passed almost 40 years ago.
